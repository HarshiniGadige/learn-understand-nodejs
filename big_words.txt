JavaScript Big Words made simple

Event Listener - The code that responds to an event.

Magic String - A string that has some special meaning in our code.

Machine Code (Machine Language) - Programming languages spoken by computer processors. Every program you run on your computer has been converted (compiled) into machine code.

ECMAScript - The standard Javascript is based on. Needed a standard since there are many JS Engines.

Javascript Engine - A program that converts JS code into something the computer processors can understand.

Breakpoint - A spot in our code where we tell a debugging tool to pause the execution of our code.

Module - A reusable block of code whose existence doesn't accidentally impact other code. Javascript did not have this feature before

CommonJS Modules - An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

First Class Functions - Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.

Expression - A block of code that results in a value.

Invoke - Run the function.

Name/Value Pair - A name which maps to a value.

Object - A collection of name/value pairs.

Object Literal - Name/value pairs seperated by commas and surrounded by curly braces.

Inheritance - One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

Function Constructors - A normal function that is used to construct objects.
The 'this' variable points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.

Primitive - A type of data that represents a single value.
Like a number or a string, not an object in general in javascript.

Scope - Where in code you have access to particular variable or function.

JSON - A standard for structuring data that is inspired by javascript object literals.
Javascript engines are built to understand it.

Revealing Module Pattern - Exposing only the properties and methods you want via the returned object.
A very common and clean way to structure and protect code within modules.

Mutate - To change something.
For example, adding a method or a property to an object means you mutate the object.

Event Listener - The code that responds to an event.
In javascript's case the listener will be a function.

Template Literal - A way to concatenate strings in Javascript (ES6).
Easier to work with than a bunch of strings concatenated with '+'.

Non Blocking - Doing other things without stopping your program from running.
This is made possible by Node's doing things asynchronously.

Buffer - A temporary holding spot for data being moved from one place to another.
Intentionality limited in size.

Stream - A sequence of data made available over time.
Pieces of data that eventually combine into a whole.

Binary Data - Data stored in binary numbers (sets of 1s and 0s)
The core of the math that computers are based on. Each one or zero is called a bit or a binary digit.

Character Set - A representation of characters as numbers
Each character gets a number. Unicode and ASCII are character sets

Character Encoding - How characters are stored in binary.
The numbers (or code points) are converted and stored in binary.

Byte - 8 bits

Callback - A function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.
The function 'calls back' back invoking the function you give it when it is done doing its work.

Error-First Callback - The callback that thakes an error object as its first parameter.
null if no error, otherwise will contain an object defining the error. This is a standard so we know in what order
to place our parameters for our callbacks.

Chunk - A piece of data being sent through a stream.
Data is split in 'chunks' and streamed

Abstract Class - A type of constructor you never work directly with, but inherit from.
We create new custom objects which inherits from the abstract base class.
